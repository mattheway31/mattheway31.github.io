		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Hello! My name is Matthew and I'm an aspiring data analyst and graduate of Cal State Fullerton's Probability & Statistics bachelor's degree prgoram. My 		career journey has been recently supercharged by completing the Google Data Analytics course and now, I'm on the hunt for new opportunities to put my 			skills into practice. While my dream is to work in sports analytics--merging my love for the game with my data-driven mindset-- I'm more than thrilled to 		tackle new challenges and gain work experience across various types of datasets. This portfolio is a peek into my work and journey. </p>
