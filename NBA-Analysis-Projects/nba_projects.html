		<h1>NBA Statistics Projects</h1>
		<p> Basketball's been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember so analyzing various statistical outputs by players that I watch every season has 			been extremely fun. It would be a dream to be able to work with a NBA team one day and help them improve with the research and analyses that I can 			contribute. </p>

		<h2>Positional 3PT Shooting Trends (2024-2025 Season)</h2>
		
		<div class ="project-card">
			<p>With the rise of 3-Point Shooting in the modern-day NBA, finding which positions shoot the 3-ball most efficiently league-wide gives me a great 				starting point. </p>

			<p>The Shooting Guard position was both the highest volume 3-point shooting position and the most effiecient at it during the 2024-2025 season. 				Historically, the Power Forward and Center positions are considered the "non-traditional" shooters and we can see that they are still not 				comparable with the other positions in regards to volume and they are still the least efficient shooters in the league.

		<h2> Positional 3PT Shooting Trends By Team (2024-2025 Season)</h2>
		
		<div class ="project-card">
			<p>Analyzing each team's 3-point efficiency by position will help us determine which teams in today's era are relying more and more on non-traditional 				3-point shooters. </p>

			<p>This heatmap compares each team's positional 3P % against the league average (36.3 %). Green indicates high efficiency (above league average) and 			red indicates low efficiency (below league average). </p>
			<p>As you can see, teams like the L.A. Clippers, Denver Nuggets, New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors, and Indiana Pacers are showing					heavy reliance on efficient shooting from their big men, indicating modern, spaced-out offensive gameplans. A team like the Clevland Cavaliers shows 			exceptional 3-point shooting across all five positions, demonstrating a well-balanced offense in terms of 3-point shooting. For the Portland 				Trailblazers, each position aside from the PF position is shooting the 3-ball below league average. </p>
