		<h1>NBA Statistics Projects</h1>
		<p> Basketball's been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember so analyzing various statistical outputs by players that I watch every season has 			been extremely fun. It would be a dream to be able to work with a NBA team one day and help them improve with the research and analyses that I can contribute. 			</p>

			<p>The Shooting Guard position was both the highest volume 3-point shooting position and the most effiecient at it during the 2024-2025 season. 				Historically, the Power Forward and Center positions are considered the "non-traditional" shooters and we can see that they are still not comparable 				with the other positions in regards to volume and they are still the least efficient shooters in the league.
